## Projects

- # Machine Learning Pneumonia Classifier (CNN)
  > [Publication](https://github.com/elfudo3/pneumonia_xray_classifier)
  > Developed a deep learning model using **PyTorch** to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. I balanced the dataset, applied preprocessing (grayscale, resize, normalize), and fine-tuned a ResNet18 model, achieving ~98% test accuracy. The project includes clear folder structure, Jupyter notebooks, and evaluation with training/validation/test splits.
  > Tech Stack: PyTorch, Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Jupyter

- # Exoplanet Habitability Analysis (EDA) - NASA Exoplanet Archive
  [Publication](https://github.com/elfudo3/exoplanet-habitability)
  > Built an exploratory data analysis pipeline on NASAâ€™s exoplanet archive to identify potentially habitable worlds. Applied filtering criteria (radius, mass, temperature, spectral type, distance), engineered a custom habitability score, and visualized results with scatter plots and radar charts comparing candidates to Earth. Produced a ranked shortlist of six promising exoplanets.
  > Tech Stack: Pandas, Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter
